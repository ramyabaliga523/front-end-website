                        "It takes a lot of imagination to be a good photographer. You need less imagination to be a painter because you can invent things. But in photography everything is so ordinary; it takes a lot of looking before you learn to see the extraordinary".

                         "Great customer service throughout covid rescheduling. Photographer was responsive and did a great job asking in advance what we were looking for. Took 2 weeks to get our pictures back- received yesterday and are thrilled with the quality shots."</p>
                         <p> Tiffany W.<br>
                            <Q>We were very skeptical of choosing a photographer this way but it worked out wonderfully. We had great communication and our pictures were back in two weeks (all 1800 of them). Our photographer was absolutely amazing!!! I highly suggest using them for your wedding.</Q></p>
                        <p> Julian Key<br>
                            <Q>From start to finish, our experience with Raw vision was efficient & budget-friendly, while still providing the freedom to choose from various artists and see their work beforehand. Our pictures and video turned out incredible. Highly recommend!</Q></p>
